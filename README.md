## Chap3: Data Types and Structures

| Object type | Meaning | Used for |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| int | Integer value | Natural numbers |
| float | Floating-point number | Natural numbers |
| bool | Boolean value | Something true or false |
| str | String object | Character, word, text |
| tuple | Immutable container | Fixed set of objects, record |
| list | Mutable container | Changing set of objects |
| dict | Mutable container | Natural numbers |
| set | Mutable container | Collection of unique objects |


##  Chap4: Numerical Computing with NumPy

| Object type | Meaning | Used for |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| ndarray (regular) | n-dimensional array object | Large arrays of numerical data |
| ndarray (record) | 2-dimensional array object | Tabular data organized in columns |

* “Arrays of Data”
This section is about the handling of arrays of data with pure Python code.

* “Regular NumPy Arrays”
This is the core section about the regular NumPy ndarray class, the workhorse in almost all data-intensive Python use cases involving numerical data.

* “Structured NumPy Arrays”
This brief section introduces structured (or record) ndarray objects for the handling of tabular data with columns.

* “Vectorization of Code”
In this section, vectorization of code is discussed along with its benefits; the section also discusses the importance of memory layout in certain scenarios.

## Chap5: Data Analysis with pandas

This chapter is about pandas, a library for data analysis with a focus on tabular data. pandas is a powerful tool that not only provides many useful classes and functions but also does a great job of wrapping functionality from other packages. The result is a user interface that makes data analysis, and in particular financial analysis, a convenient and efficient task.

| Object type | Meaning | Used for |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| DataFrame | 2-dimensional data object with index | Tabular data organized in columns |
| Series | 1-dimensional data object with index | Single (time) series of data |

* “The DataFrame Class”
This section starts by exploring the basic characteristics and capabilities of the DataFrame class of pandas by using simple and small data sets; it then shows how to transform a NumPy ndarray object into a DataFrame object.

* “The Series Class”
This rather brief section covers the Series class of pandas, which in a sense represents a special case of the DataFrame class with a single column of data only.

* “GroupBy Operations”
One of the strengths of the DataFrame class lies in grouping data according to a single or multiple ...
